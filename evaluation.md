You guys obviously have a lot of catching up to do, from a technical standpoint. We knew that going in, and will continue to work on it over the holiday break and through the end of the course.

Beyond that, however, there are three things that stand out to me as concerns specific to this project:
1. There is only one person's name associated with all of the commits.
2. The app does not seem to leverage skills that you gained earlier in the course. Having trouble with an Express backend doesn't mean that you can't have clear planning documents, multiple views that reflect your user stories, routes that render those additional views, or pseudo-code/comments in your controllers outlining the CRUD functionality that needs to be implemented. As it stands, your app looks and behaves more like a sandbox for testing external dependencies that it does a user-oriented product in progress.
